# 🎓 Classmate AI  

**Classmate AI** is an interactive **chat-based application** where users can upload **documents, websites, or YouTube videos** as knowledge sources, and then ask **questions in natural language**.  

The system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant context from the uploaded sources and generate intelligent responses.  

Think of it like having your very own **AI-powered study buddy** — ask questions, and it answers using your uploaded materials.

## 🚀 Features
- 💬 **Chat with AI** – ask natural questions and get answers grounded in your own data.  
- 📂 **Upload Knowledge Sources** – PDFs, Websites, and YouTube transcripts.  
- 🔍 **RAG-based Querying** – fetches the most relevant chunks for accurate answers.  
- 📝 **Source Citations** – see exactly which documents were used.  
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** – clean, responsive, and with markdown + code highlighting.  
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications** – smooth feedback for uploads, errors, and actions.  
- ⚡ **Real-time Updates** – optimistic updates and loading spinners for smooth UX.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture  

1. **User Uploads a Source**  
   - File (PDF), Website, or YouTube link is processed.  
   - Content is chunked & embedded → stored in **Qdrant vector DB**.  

2. **User Asks a Question**  
   - Query is embedded.  
   - Qdrant retrieves most relevant chunks.  

3. **RAG Pipeline**  
   - Retrieved context + user query are sent to the LLM.  
   - AI generates a **grounded response** with citations.  

4. **Frontend Display**  
   - Messages appear in a chat interface.  
   - Markdown is rendered with **code highlighting & scrollable blocks**.
